Some introduction about Kotlin property delegates, around what they can do and why they exist.

<!--more-->

# Existing Delegates

The Kotlin language has a few delegates that exist already for us to use. 

## Vetoable

This allows us to veto new values.

## Observable

This allows us to observe new values.

## notNull

This allows us to ensure new values are not null.

# Creating Your Own Delegates

We can create our own property delegates if we'd like, to cover specific use cases.

## SharedPrefsDelegate

Show how we can store something in SharedPrefs when we read/write. 

## Some Other Delegate?

Try to come up with another unique delegate, like maybe an `ObservableField` type of thing? 

## Recap

Tell 'em what you told 'em, link 'em to resources.
